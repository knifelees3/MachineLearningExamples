# Maching Learning Examples
This is the maching learning repository, there will be some notes and program in this folder

# Learning Plan

- [ ] Write down the MINIST learning program by myselfy
- [x] Learn the use of Pytorch to do MINIST 
- [ ] Learn the use of SVM to do classification
  - [ ] Classify the dipole model
  - [ ] Classify the physical or numerical mode
- [ ] Learn the use of SVR to do regressions
  - [ ] To do 1d curve fitting
  - [ ] To do pattern fitting
  - [ ] To predict the structure which can be used generate the pulse shape
